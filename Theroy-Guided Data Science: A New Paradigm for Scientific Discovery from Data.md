    - [[Introduction]]
        * TGDS aims to advance our scientific understanding by discovering novel domain
        insights
        * Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm that aims to leverage
        the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The
        overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an essential component for learning generalizable models
