# KEY CONTRIBUTION

# FUTURE RESEARCH 

* research should also includes the following factors including
    * genetic relation to geographic location
        * genetic relations pertaining the geographical location need to be 
         studied in to order to confirm the forecase 
    * Ethnicity
        * civilization, society, culter
    * treatment options
        * current research assume that vaccination option will be avialbe for the next one year

# CHALLENGES

* factors that make forecasting model hard 
    * incubation period is alot longer 
    * tracking of the people
    * * no definitive treatment
    * the high fatality rate in susceptible people
    * longer incubation period
    * lack of proper data  
        * china dataset is overly used in researched.
        * few dataset is available at the time.
    * proper lockdown
        * how to implement it 
    * the optimal period of lockdown
    * aware but do not casue panic 
        * lets citizen knows without causing panic
    * essential services identification and delivery
        * what are essential services?
    * crystal clear communication of message
        * how to avoid misinformation and miscommunication?
