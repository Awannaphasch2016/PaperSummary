* architecutre
    * graph construction
        * node 
            * node represent places 
                * eg
                    * districts, municipalities, cities, states, regions, countries
            * 2 types of features 
                * static feature
                    * the same value during the netire observation period 
                    * eg
                        * number of inhabitant
                        * density of population 
                * dynamic feature
                    * change over time,
                    * eg
                        *  features are the mean radius of movments of individuals within the place,
                            and percentage of individuals who spend more than three hours outside their home
        * edges
            * edges = spread link of the epidemic
                * eg
                    * movement of infected individuals
        * graph 
            * graph at different movement of time allow the depict the infection dynamics 
    * model
        * it is hybrid model
            * maps the input data to the underlying properties of an epidemiological model 
                * such as 
                    * contact rate and recovery rate of a SIR model
        * 2 building block
            * contact rate estimator
                * it jointed exploited structed data and temporal information to estimate the contact rate at time t.
                * GCN captures the topological strucutre of the network of places and provides an embedding 
                    for each place of the network at time t
                * spatial embedding from GCN is fed to LSTM.
            * epidemiological model
                * it predicts the evolution of hte epidemic based on previous data and parameters 
                    learned by the neural network.
                * SIR compartmentalized model is used for epidemiological model
                    * parameters obtained from contact rate estimators are fed to SIR.
