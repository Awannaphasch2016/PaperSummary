            * Different from
            traditional approaches like ERGM models, realistic social
            contact networks are irregular, unstructured and dynamically changing, therefore difficult to measure or describe
            with any single metric.
        - [[Evaluation]]
            * goal of validation process is to achieve the following.
                * data validation
                    * matching diverse measured data sources,
                    such as properties reported in the census, traffic, and peopleâ€™s activities,
                * functional validation
                    * ensuring the synthetic network is based on accepted social theories and data
                    integration techniques
                * structure validateion
                    * we
                    use approaches from statistical physics and complex systems
                    to show several emergent properties are consistent with observed system-level phenomena
            * We describe a number of metrics for comparing the two networks
                * metrics are divided into 4 classes 
                    1. metrics that capture the features of the population, built infrastructure and their layout (network labeling structure)
                    2. network level metrics that capture the structure features of the dynamic social contact networks. 
                    3. dynamical features that capture the epidemic dynamics over the networks 
                    4. policy metrics that capture the effect of controls.
        - [[Architecture]]
            * 2 methods for synthetic populations and networks for Delhi and Los Angeles.
                * both methods consist of the following broad steps 
                    *  (i) synthesize a baseline
                    population with a detailed individual structure and the same
                    aggregate statistical properties of the real population; 
                    * (ii)
                    assign each individual a reasonable activity schedule based
                    on mobility survey; 
                    * (iii) create locations in the region where
                    synthetic people can take their activities.
                * The two methods differ in specific models used in each
                step because the data sources of the two cities have different format or quality.
                    * Delhi 
                        * First, subjective surveys regarding
                        individual behavior in residential areas are used to synthesize the Delhi network but not for the Los Angeles network.
                        This is because about 40% of the population in Delhi do not
                        travel on a daily basis and have activities mainly in their
                        home and neighborhood.
                        * travel survey is for Thane city is utilized.
                    * Los Angeles
                        *  Second, some data sets used to
                        synthesize the Los Angeles network are more refined than
                        the ones used to construct the Delhi network, for example
                        the activity survey data. In the Delhi network, no activity survey is available for the Delhi population.
