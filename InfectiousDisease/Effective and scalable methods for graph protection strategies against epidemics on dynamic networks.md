        - [[Data]]
            * Dutch College dataset is a directed network of friendship ratings among 32 university
            freshmen (Van de Bunt et al. 1999). Each student was asked to rate the others at
            eeven different time points.
            * Hospital dataset contains the temporal network of human contacts between patients
            and health-care workers in a hospital ward in Lyon, France (Vanhems et al. 2013).
            Data was collected in December 2010.
            * Hypertext 2009 dataset is the network of contacts of the attendees of the ACM
            Hypertext 2009 conference (Stehlé et al. 2011). In the network, a node represents a
            conference visitor, and an edge represents a face-to-face contact.
            * PrimarySchool dataset contains the temporal network of contacts between teachers
            and children used in the study of BMC Infectious Diseases 2014 (Gemmetto et al.
            2014; Stehlé et al. 2011).
            * Highschool 2013 dataset contains the temporal network of contacts between
            students in a high school in Marseilles, France (Mastrandrea et al. 2015). The data
            was collected in December 2011 and November 2012.
            * Infectious dataset is the network of face-to-face people behavior during the Dublin
            Science Gallery 2009 exhibition (Isella et al. 2011).
            * Email dataset was obtained from the email communication between institution
            members (the core) from a large European research institution (Paranjape et al.
            2017). A directed edge (u, v, t) means that person u sent an e-mail to person v at time
            t in the network.
        * [[Models]]
            * None: simulates the condition without any protection.
            * GreedyMVC: approximates the set of MVC nodes of the input graph by greedily
            selects the uncovered edge with the maximum sum of degrees of its endpoints (Khalil
            et al. 2017). Then protects k nodes from this unordered MVC set.
            * Degree (Prakash et al. 2010): protects k highest degree nodes of the current snapshot
            of the dynamic network. This method represents the concept of NLDS-Degree by
            Prakash et al. (2010).
            * Betweenness: protects k nodes with the highest betweenness centrality of the current
            snapshot of the dynamic network.
            * NetShield+ (Tong et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2016; Prakash et al. 2010): aims to protect a
            set of k nodes considering the largest eigenvalue of adjacency matrix. This methods
            represents the stronger variant of eigendecomposition-based methods by Chen et al.
            (2016) and NLDS-EigenValue by Prakash et al. (2010).
            * GraphShield (Wijayanto and Murata 2017): protects k nodes by taking into account
            the role of graph connectivity and degree centrality.
            * ApproxDegree: simulates the 2-approximation algorithm to get the MVC nodes
            (Chakrabarti; Hartman and Weigt 2006). We add the degree-ordering nodes to this
            method for protecting the top-k highest degree of MVC nodes.

                of SIR epidemic in network by Pastor-Satorras (2015), we can analytically describe the
                SIR model using generating function approach, where the probability that a link exists
                is related to the probability of transmission of the disease from an infected node to a

            * We observe that the time-aggregation of all edges make the network denser thus
            require more nodes to be protected.
            * In
            the aggregated network, the average degree of nodes is higher than in each network
            snapshot.

        - [[Architecture]]
            * note
                * At first, we aim to find the set of the most critical nodes in the input network. Many
                previous studies suggest that a certain critical node criterion is best for a certain type
                of network structure
                    * For instance, degree centrality is most suitable for dense and
                    highly centralized network (Lawyer 2015; Chen et al. 2016), while betweenness centrality
                    and connectivity are well fit for clustered networks with the existence of graph bridges
                    (Italiano et al. 2012; Khan et al. 2015; Lawyer 2015).
            * graph construction
                * edges construction
                    * Specifically, for each edge, we generate a random number. If the edge weight is smaller than the generated random number, the edge will be removed.

                    generated using [[Dynamic Attributed Network with Community Structure Generator (DANCER)]] (Largeron et al. 2017). 
                * real network
                    * On real-world networks, we compare the performance of all comparison methods on
                    seven different datasets and two different epidemic models, i.e., SIS and SIR model.
            * Transmission Dynamics
                * note
                    * . Gillespie algorithm (Kiss et al. 2017) is used to simulate the epidemic spreading on networks.
                    * Additionally, we follow the time discretization method of
                    dynamic network by Zhuang et al. (2013).
                * SIS
                    * We let the epidemic spreading arrive at the stationary state before chjanging to the next
                    snapshot of the network for SIS model. 
                * SIR
                    * While for SIR model, we count the ratio of surviving nodes at the highest outbreak point, right before the final regime of epidemics as
                    suggested by Pastor-Satorras et al. (2015). For continuity, in SIR model, we restart the
                    epidemic spreading in the new snapshot after the final regime of epidemic spreading in
                    the previous snapshot.

                    * Using the multiple-turns protection, we aim to
                    address the changing of network structure and incoming rumor or virus attacks during
                    the temporal transition in dynamic networks
                    *  To restrain the spreading
                    of epidemic in dynamic networks, we divide the protection budget wisely into several
                    turns. The protected nodes are selected in each turn according to the currently observed
                    temporal snapshot of dynamic network.

                        * More specifically, we leverage the n-step [[fitted Q-Learning]] (Khalil et al. 2017) to obtain
                        MVC approximation with an efficient training process and scalable implementation.
                        Hence, our proposed methods take the advantage of n-step [[Q-Learning]] (Sutton and Barto
                        1998) and [[fitted Q-iteration]] (Riedmiller 2005).

        * note
            * We consider that the reinforcement learning is more suitable for graph protection
            on dynamic networks due to at least two major reasons
                * First, reinforcement learning approach using convolutional neural network as function approximator gives us a
                potential benefit to learn from previously solved MVC of network snapshot. By learning
                the given temporal structure of observed networks, this provides an incentive to predict future protection from previously learned actions in the same dynamic networks
                * Second, the nature of convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide us not only scalability
                in handling the large size networks which may contain up to billion nodes, but also easily parallelizable in multiple CPUs and GPUs. Here, we leverage our approach on top of
                recent advances in deep learning technology. Traditional MVC approximation algorithms
                are not specifically designed for this computationally expensive task.
        1. (Effectiveness) How effective are the proposed methods in restraining epidemic
        spreading in both synthetic and real-world dynamic networks? We define the measurement of effectiveness using the surviving ratio (θ) of nodes in dynamic network GD at the
        end of epidemics.
            * [[simulated network]]
                * When the given protection budget k is too
                small, ReProtect and ReProtect-p exhibit competitive performances with other methods, but with an increasing k, they easily outperform other baseline methods, such as
                Degree, GraphShield, and Betweenness.
                * On the other hand, ReProtect can also outperform other competing methods, even though it needs a bigger protection budget to obtain
                the similar performance of ReProtect-p
            * [[real network]]
                * Both
                of our proposed methods consistently reach the highest ratio of surviving nodes. Additionally, in most cases, the proposed method with more training data variety using the
                perturbed graph, namely ReProtect-p achieves a better result than the regular training as
                in ReProtect. 
                * The consistency of better
                performance shown by our methods in many different numbers of available protection
                budget indicates the reliability as protection strategies.
            * [[aggregate network]]
                * In this subsection, we report the effectiveness evaluation on the aggregate networks of
                the same synthetic and real-world datasets.
                * we found that the multiple-turns time-based
                strategies are beneficial and more effective than the aggregate-based strategies
        2. (Scalability) Are the proposed methods scalable with respect to the changing of graph
        size (in terms of the number of nodes) and different protection budget size (k)?
            * note
                * Let us recall our second evaluation goal, which aims to measure how scalable is the proposed method with respect to the changing of graph size and different k budget size
            * simualted network
                * our methods scale slmost linearly with respect to the number of nodes .
                * Further paralelization of neural
                network design can also be applied to speed up the running time
        3. (Sensitivity Analysis) How is the effectiveness of our proposed methods in the
        different values of epidemic parameters, such as the infection rate (β) and recovery
        rate (δ)?
            * note 
                * the following evaluation are experimented.
                    * (1) Comparison of survival ratio θ when the epidemic propagation rate  (β/δ)
                    changes
                    * (2) Comparison of survival ratio θ when the infection rate (β) changes
                    * (3) Comparison of survival ratio θ when the recovery rate (δ) changes
            * the purposed method Reprotect and ReProtect-p are least sensitive in comparison to other methods
