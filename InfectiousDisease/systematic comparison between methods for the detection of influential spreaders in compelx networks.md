            * We quantify the performance of the various methods on a
            corpus of 100 real-world network
                * the corpus consists of networks small enough for the application of greedy
                optimization so that results from this algorithm are used as the baseline needed for the analysis of the performance of the other methods on the same corpus of networks

    - [[Related Work]]
        * The literature on the subject is plenty of purely topological
        methods for the identification of influential spreaders in networks
            * However, it is unclear how far these methods are from being optimal.

            * influence maximization
                * it is the problem of finding the set of nodes of a network that maximized the size of the outbreak of a spreading process ocurring on the network.  
                * This setting makes the optimization problem computationally infeasible for standard greedy optimization algorithms that account simultaneously for information about network
                topology and spreading dynamics, leaving space only to heuristic methods based on the drastic approximation
                of relying on the geometry of the network alone

        *  We find that relatively simple network metrics,
        such as adaptive degree or closeness centralities, are able to achieve performances very close to the baseline
        value, thus providing good support for the use of these metrics in large-scale problem settings
        * Also, we show
        that a further 2 âˆ’ 5% improvement towards the baseline performance is achievable by hybrid algorithms that
        combine two or more topological metrics together.
