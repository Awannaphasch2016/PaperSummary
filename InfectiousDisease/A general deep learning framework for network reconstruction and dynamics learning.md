# INTRODUCTION
* Much attention has been paid on how
collective dynamics on networks are determined by the topology of graph
    * However, in
    real cases, only the performances, i.e., the time series of nodes states are observed, but the
    network structure and the dynamical rules are not known.
        * Thus, the inverse problems,
        i.e., inferring network topology and dynamical rules based on the observed dynamics data,
        is more significant.

        * Boolean Network is a widely studied model that is often used to model gene regulatory
        networks

        * The Kuramoto model (Kuramoto 1975) is a nonlinear system of phase-coupled oscillators,
        and it is often used to describe synchronization
    * coupled map lacttice 
        * Coupled map lattices represent a dynamical model with discrete time and continuous
        state variables(Kaneko 1992; 1989),it is widely used to study the chaotic dynamics of
        spatially extended systems.
