        5. Extensions 
            * The standard stochastic epidemic model of Section2.3 was de-fined as a stochastic version of the deterministic general epidemicmodel of Section2.1. The population is finite, and infectious indi-viduals make contacts randomly in time according to a Poissonprocess with intensityk, each time the person being contacted ischosen uniformly at random from the population, and the lengthof the infectious periodIis a random variable with distributionI
                * Despite these more realistic model features, the model still con-tains several simplifying assumptions
                * In the present section wetouch upon a number of extensions that have been analysed inthe literature. Most of these extensions do not alter the qualitativebehaviour of the spread of infection, but they do change quantita-tive properties
            5.1 [[there are more]] Inidivual heterogeneity: multitype models 
                * One assumption in the standard stochastic epidemic model isthat all individuals are similar, except the possibility that theirinfectious periods have different lengths. In reality most popula-tions are heterogeneous, for example with respect to susceptibility,the degree of social activity and/or how infectious they become ifinfected. The heterogeneities may be unknown to some extent,but quite often it is possible to group individuals into differenttypesof individual, where individuals of the same type have(nearly) identical behaviour. This separation into different typesmight for example be different age groups, gender, previous expe-rience of the disease (giving partial immunity) etc
