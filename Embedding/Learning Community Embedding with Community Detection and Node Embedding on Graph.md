        * community detection 
            * Earlier community detection methods on homogeneous graphs often apply
            different clustering algorithms directly on the graph adjacency
            matrix. For example, in [25], spectral clustering is applied to the
            social networks for extracting the communities. In [13], a Laplacian
            Regularized GMM is trained to capture the manifold structure of a
            nearest neighbor graph
            * deep learning
                * Such work usually first embeds the graph in a low-dimensional
                space, and then apply clustering algorithms such as K-means on the
                embedding results
                    * Despite the success of these node embedding
                    based methods in detecting communities, they often do not jointly
                    optimize node embedding and community detection together
                        *  As
                        their goals are mainly community detection, they do not necessarily
                        have an explicit notion of community embedding
