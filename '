    - [[Introduction]]
        * Constructing effective and scalable protection strategies over epidemic propagation is
        a challenging issue. It has been attracting interests in both theoretical and empirical
        studies. However, most of the recent developments are limited to the simplified
        single-layered network
            * . Multiplex social networks are social networks with multiple
            layers where the same set of nodes appear in different layers. Consequently, a single
            attack can trigger simultaneous propagation in all corresponding layers
                * Therefore,
                suppressing propagation in multiplex topologies is more challenging given the fact
                that each layer also has a different structure
        * Real-world networks reveal the existence of multiple levels relationships. For instance,
        in social networks, an individual can possess membership of several communities which
        range in different functionalities from intimate (e.g., families, friends, clubs) to more serious (e.g., businesses, schools)
            * In social networks, one can categorize edges based on the
            nature of the relationships (i.e., ties) or actions that they represent (Kivela et al. 2014).
            Reducing a social system to a network in which actors are connected in a pairwise fashion
            by only a single type of relationship is often a crude approximation of reality.
            * Furthermore,
            the current insights in complex network analysis does not only consider networks as isolated graphs, but also characterizes how a network interacts with other networks and how
            this interaction affects epidemic spreading that occur on top of them (Kivela et al. 2014).

    - [[Key Contribution]]
        * We formalize the problem of suppressing propagation spreading in multiplex network by
        allocating protection resources throughout the different network layers. We define the
        Multiplex Graph Protection Problem as a discrete combinatorial optimization
        * We also
        introduce that the problem is NP-Hard. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
        analyze the hardness of this multiplex graph protection problem.
        * Furthermore, we also
        specify two different protection scheme to consider different epidemic spreading scenario
        in multiplex networks.
        * We develop an effective and scalable algorithm to suppress the epidemics spreading on
        multiplex networks, called MULTIPLEXSHIELD
            * We find that MULTIPLEXSHIELD is scalable for large graphs and gives more effective protection compared with other competing
            methods such as Acquaintance Vaccination (AV) (Wang et al. 2015), Targeted Immunization Method (TIM) (Buono and Braunstein 2015), SpreadingDegree (Zhao et al. 2014) and
            Random Immunization (Zuzek et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2014).
            * We also show that
            MULTIPLEXSHIELD is scalable with respect to the changing of graph size in terms of
            number of nodes and edges, which means it is suitable for large size graphs.

        * [[Graph Protection]]
            * Most of the recent work in graph protection focused on the single-layered graph
            and does not provide much consideration on multiplex topologies.
                *  In single-layered
                graph protection scheme, there are two common approaches: pre-emptive and postemptive protection
                    * pre-emptive protection
                        * matrix perturbation 
                            * Two pre-emptive algorithms have been proposed, called NetShield
                            (Tong et al. 2010) and Netshield+ (Chen et al. 2016) which employ the properties of
                            matrix perturbation to find a set of nodes to be immunized (Tong et al. 2010).

        - [[Tasks]]
            * Given a multiplex graph, such as a
            social network, and k budget of protection resources, we aim to protect a set of nodes
            such that the percentage of survived nodes at the end of epidemics is maximized
                * We define the
                Multiplex Graph Protection Problem as a discrete combinatorial optimization
        - [[Evaluation]]
        - [[Architecture]]
            * Thus, the protection scheme in multiplex networks can be classified into two basic
            classes: multiplex-based and layer-based node protection schemes. Figure 1 illustrates
            this classification
            * The goal of our work is to develop an effective and efficient method that is scalable
                    for protecting multiplex networks.
                    * Firstly, we allocate a novel nodes importance ranking
                    score which combines the benefit of algebraic connectivity and degree centrality of graph
                    structure
                    * 
            * This node score consists of the corresponding random walk normalized Fiedler vector of nodes in graph, degree value, and
            layer-wise epidemic stochastic propagation rate.
            * We use SIS model in our work. In SIS
            propagation model (Gray et al. 2011), we calculate the stochastic propagation rate from
            the ratio between the infection probability of one node to infect its neighbor and the
            recovery probability of infected node. This rate represents the strength of propagation
            and exhibits how quick the epidemics will spread. Prakash et al. (2011) showed that the
            strength of propagation in SIS model, as well as in SIR, SIRS, and SEIR model depends on
            this rate
