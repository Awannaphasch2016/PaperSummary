# introduction

* Initial stages of drug discovery require localization of a disease cause, understanding of the molecular
mechanism, then suggesting and testing drug leads. On a cellular level, a drug molecule binds to
a target biomolecule and amends its function
    * Once the disease target has been identified a list
    of drug candidates is drafted and screened for the target-candidate binding affinities.

* The ligand with stronger attraction (binding affinity) wins the competition deciding whether the
reaction chain is activated or blocked.
