    * using "additive predictors", to incorpoarting different graph structure, 
    * "smoothing" can be used as trade off between complexity and interpretability
    * to account ffor epistemic uncertainty, deep ensemble can be used where each models are trained from scratch with a different random initialization

* additive effect
    * when two predictors do not interact, we say that each predictor has an "additive effect' on the response.
        * More formally, a regression model contains additive effects if the response function can be written as a 
         sum of function of the predictor varialbes
* additive predictor 
    * structure additive predictor
        * representa mooth additive effectos of input features and can be reresented in a neural network.
        * it can be represented in neural network term

# STANDARD AND BASELINE
# METHODOLOGY

* Q1: Is DeepCovid able to anticipate trend changes?
* Q2. Does DeepCovid capture finer grain patterns?
* Q3. How does DeepCovid perform in US National short term forecasting?
* Q4. does DeepCovid's emphasis on short -term forecastin scarifice longer-term performance?
* Q5. Can DeepCovid explains its prediction to epidemiological exports for interpretation?
